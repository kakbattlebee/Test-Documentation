### 📝 Post-Release Website Testing Plan

#### 1️⃣ Introduction

**Testing Objective:**  
Verify core functional and non-functional capabilities of the website post-release, ensuring operability, security, and performance.

**Testing Scope:**

* Authorization and registration
* Ticket search
* Tariff loading
* Checkout and payment
* Notification sending
* UI/UX
* Security
* Performance

---

#### 2️⃣ Testing Strategy

**Testing Methodologies:**

* **Smoke Testing** – checking key functionalities (login, search, payment)
* **Regression Testing** – ensuring new changes haven’t disrupted existing functionality
* **Functional Testing** – validating correct operation of website features
* **UI/UX Testing** – ensuring correct interface display
* **Security Testing** – verifying data protection measures
* **Performance Testing** – load and stress testing

**Testing Priorities:**

1. **Critical functionality** (authorization, search, payment)
2. **Filters, tariffs, ticket delivery**
3. **UI, responsiveness, visual elements**

---

#### 3️⃣ Testing Objects

**Main Modules:**

* Authorization and authentication
* Ticket search
* Tariff loading
* Order checkout
* Post-payment processing
* Receipt download

**Associated Systems:**

* Payment gateways (banks, Payze)
* Databases
* External APIs (ticket aggregators ETS)

---

#### 4️⃣ Successful Testing Criteria

✅ Authorization functions correctly across all supported devices  
✅ Ticket search displays relevant results without issues  
✅ Tariffs load accurately and show correct pricing  
✅ Payments are processed successfully and correctly  
✅ No critical errors or vulnerabilities

#### 5️⃣ Types of Testing

🔹 **Smoke Testing:**

* Website availability check
* Verification of core functions (authorization, search, payment)

🔹 **Functional Testing:**

* Correct functioning of filters and sorting in search
* Ticket pricing verification
* Successful and unsuccessful payment scenarios

🔹 **UI/UX Testing:**

* Mobile and tablet responsiveness
* Interface accuracy across browsers

🔹 **Security Testing:**

* HTTPS and data encryption validation
* Protection testing against SQL injections and XSS attacks

🔹 **Performance Testing:**

* Search results loading under high load
* Server performance with increased user traffic

---

#### 6️⃣ Testing Tools

🔹 **Postman** – API testing (search, tariffs, payments)  
🔹 **JMeter** – performance/load testing  
🔹 **DevTools (Chrome, Firefox)** – UI and responsiveness validation

---

#### 7️⃣ Role Distribution

👨‍💻 **QA Engineer:** Executes test cases, logs defects  
👩‍💻 **Developer:** Analyzes and fixes identified bugs  
📢 **Project Manager:** Makes release decisions

---

#### 8️⃣ Anticipated Risks and Mitigation Strategies

| Risk | Mitigation Strategy |
| ----- | ----- |
| Critical post-release errors | Conduct smoke testing before deployment |
| Server load failures | Perform load testing |
| Payment processing issues | Validate integration with payment gateways |
| User data leakage | Conduct security testing |

---

#### 9️⃣ Conclusion

If no critical errors are found, the website is considered ready for launch. 🚀 In the case of serious issues, they must be addressed and retested before re-release.
